**Figures**
Some code used for plotting main figures for final paper.

**Tracking Algorithms**

_eulerian_CL_tracking.ipynb_
Uses local max algorithm applied at each z-level applied across y-slices to find convergence line based on "convergence threshold". 
This threshold is dependent on data and should be tested by the researcher.

_lagrangian_tracking.ipynb_
Tracks parcels from within 0-1 km above LFC back in time to when vertical velocitiy W is within 2 km of CL.
Produced tracked parcels are refered to as "tracked parcels".

_lagrangian_cloud_BFS.ipynb_
Runs BFS algorithm at each level based on tracked parcels and averages these "clouds" and creates 2D histograms.

_eulerian_updrafts.ipynb_
Makes vertical profiles of variables including W, QV, QC,TH using "eulerian averaging" of thresholded locations (w>1, qc+qi>1e-6).

_Eulerian_Budget_Profile.ipynb_
Vertical profiles of budget variables using "eulerian binning" of thresholded locations (w>1, qc+qi>1e-6).

_DEEP_Lagrangian_Budget_Profile.ipynb_
Vertical profiles of budget variables using "lagrangian parcel binning" specific to Deep Convective tracked parcels.

_lagrangian_updrafts.ipynb_
Makes vertical profiles of variables including W, QV, QC,TH using "lagrangian parcel averaging" of thresholded locations (w>1, qc+qi>1e-6).

_Eulerian + Lagrangian Updraft.ipynb_
Combines plots from "eulerian_updrafts.ipynb" and "lagrangian_updrafts.ipynb" into one figure.

_Entrainment Profiles.ipynb_
Functions to calculate entrainment. Data is binned into vertical profiles and plotted for "general" and "cloudy updrafts".

RESIDENCE.ipynb
goal is to track dry air entrainment effects on cloudy updrafts, residence times, etc. currently in testing phase.

**Cold_Pool_Tracking**
