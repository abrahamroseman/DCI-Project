MAIN DIRECTORIES

1. _/Variable_Calculations/_
	Makes calculations for variables/data_files not including in model output

	(a) _/CalculateMoreVariables/_
		Creates Variables Not Included in Model Output
		Including 2D_Moisture_Convergence, Buoyancy, Convergence, 
		Equivalent_Potential_temperature, Eulerian_Binary_Array, 
		Eulerian_VMF, Moist_Static_Energy, and Virtual_Potential_Temperature
	(b) _/TimeSplitModelVariables/_
		Splits variables into individual files for each timestep
	(c) _/EntrainmentCalculation/_
		Calculates Entrainment using Lagrangian Particles
	(d) _/LagrangianArrays/_
		Makes calculations of variables from both model and _/CalculateMoreVariables/_ into Lagrangian form based on Lagrangian 
		particles

2. _/Project_Algorithms/_
	(a) _/Domain_Profiles/_
		Makes "binned" vertical profiles for select variables from model data
	Code for tracking eulerian updrafts and cloudy updrafts.
	(b) _/Tracking_Algorithms/_
		Code for tracking convergence lines (Eulerian)
		Code for tracking updrafts and cloudy updrafts from CL to LFC (using Lagrangian particles).
		Code for subsetting tracked parcels into CL/nonCL/SBF and All/Shallow/Deep parcels.
	(b) _/Tracked_Profiles/_
		Makes "binned" vertical profiles for select variables from tracked parcel data


ADDITIONAL DIRECTORIES
